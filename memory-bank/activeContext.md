# Active Context: Discord Voice Recorder

## Current Focus
- Initial project setup and core functionality implementation
- Basic voice recording capabilities
- Simple command handling

## Implementation Decisions

### Architecture
- Single file implementation for simplicity
- Direct command handling without complex routing
- Straightforward file management approach

### Command Structure
- Using `!record` and `!stop` commands
- Simple text-based feedback messages
- Basic error reporting to users

### Recording Process
- Record all users in voice channel
- Store as temporary files
- Convert to MP3 before upload

### File Management
- Local storage in `recordings/` directory
- Automatic cleanup after successful upload
- Sequential naming for recordings

## Current Patterns

### Code Organization
```javascript
// Main bot setup and event handling
// Voice recording functions
// File management functions
```

### Error Handling
- Try/catch blocks for critical operations
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful failure recovery

## Active Decisions

### Technical Choices
- Using discord.js for bot framework
- ffmpeg for audio processing
- Local file system for storage

### Implementation Approach
- Keep code simple and maintainable
- Minimize external dependencies
- Focus on core functionality first

## Current Learnings

### Key Insights
- Simple architecture is sufficient for requirements
- Direct command handling is adequate
- Basic file management meets needs

### Development Focus
- Core functionality implementation
- Basic error handling
- Essential user feedback

## Next Steps
1. Implement basic bot setup
2. Add voice channel joining
3. Implement recording functionality
4. Add file conversion and upload
5. Test basic workflow

## Current Challenges
- Managing voice channel connections
- Handling audio conversion
- Implementing proper cleanup
- Error handling for edge cases

## Implementation Notes
- Keep code organization simple
- Focus on reliability
- Maintain clear user feedback
- Ensure proper resource cleanup
