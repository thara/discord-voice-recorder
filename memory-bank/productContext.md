# Product Context: Discord Voice Recorder

## Purpose & Problem Solving
The Discord Voice Recorder bot addresses several key needs:
- Capturing important voice conversations for future reference
- Recording team meetings or group discussions
- Preserving voice content for members who couldn't attend live
- Creating voice content archives for community servers

## User Experience Goals

### Simplicity
- Minimal command set (`!record`, `!stop`)
- No complex configuration required
- Intuitive workflow that matches user expectations
- Clear feedback at each step of the process

### Reliability
- Consistent audio quality for voice recordings
- Predictable bot behavior
- Immediate response to commands
- Reliable file delivery

### User Workflow

1. Initial Setup
   - Bot is added to server
   - Bot has necessary permissions
   - Users understand basic commands

2. Starting a Recording
   - User joins a voice channel
   - User types `!record` in any text channel
   - Bot joins the voice channel
   - Bot confirms recording has started

3. During Recording
   - Bot captures all voice activity
   - All users in channel are recorded
   - Normal voice channel activities continue uninterrupted

4. Ending a Recording
   - User types `!stop` in any text channel
   - Bot confirms recording is stopping
   - Bot processes the audio file
   - Bot uploads the MP3 to the channel
   - Bot leaves the voice channel

## User Interaction Patterns

### Command Response Flow
1. User Command → Bot Acknowledgment
2. Bot Action → Status Update
3. Task Completion → Result Sharing

### Error Handling

- Guidance for resolving problems
- Graceful handling of edge cases

### User Feedback

- Clear success/failure notifications

## Privacy & Safety Considerations
- Only records when explicitly commanded
- Clearly indicates when recording is active
- Stops recording if bot is disconnected
- Only allows recording control by users in the voice channel

## Success Metrics
- Command response time
- Recording quality
- File processing speed
- Upload reliability
- User command success rate
